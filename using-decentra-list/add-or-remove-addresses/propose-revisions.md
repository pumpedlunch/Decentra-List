# Propose Revisions

1. Select your desired Ethereum network in the top right corner and the List to revise in the dropdown.
2. Click the Add Addresses or Remove Addresses button.
3. Approve the List contract to spend the Total Bond amount by clicking the Submit Approval Button and signing the transaction in your wallet.
4. Enter the addresses to Add or Remove. Up to 99 addresses can be included in one proposal.
5. Click submit Transaction and sign the transaction in your wallet.

* Note: the Oracle will review the proposed addresses as a whole, so if a proposed revision includes one address that is incorrect, the entire proposal will be rejected, and the proposer’s Total Bond lost.
* Note: the Addition and Removal Rewards are calculated based on the number of addresses revised on the List and paid at the time of execution.&#x20;
* Note: If the List contract does not have sufficient token balance to pay the calculated rewards upon execution, the full proposal is still executed and the proposer will receive the List’s token balance.
